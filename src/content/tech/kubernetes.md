# Kubernetes

## Overview

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Why Adopt?

- **Industry Standard**: De facto standard for container orchestration
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Self-healing**: Automatic restart and replacement of failed containers
- **Declarative Configuration**: Infrastructure as code approach
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions

## Use Cases

- Microservices architectures
- CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-cloud deployments
- Hybrid cloud setups
- Batch processing workloads

## Considerations

- Complexity requires dedicated expertise
- Overhead for simple applications
- Security configuration is critical
- Cost optimization needs attention

## Best Practices

- Use namespaces for environment separation
- Implement resource limits and requests
- Use Helm charts for application packaging
- Implement proper monitoring and logging
- Follow security best practices (RBAC, network policies)

## Recommendations

Kubernetes is recommended for production deployments of containerized applications, especially for microservices architectures and teams with DevOps capabilities.

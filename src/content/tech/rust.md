# Rust

## Overview

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It achieves memory safety without garbage collection.

## Why Trial?

- **Memory Safety**: Prevents common bugs without runtime overhead
- **Performance**: C/C++ level performance
- **Concurrency**: Fearless concurrency without data races
- **Modern Tooling**: Excellent tooling with cargo
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Rapidly expanding library ecosystem

## Use Cases

- High-performance services
- WebAssembly applications
- CLI tools
- Systems programming
- Data processing pipelines

## Considerations

- Steep learning curve
- Longer development time initially
- Smaller talent pool
- Compile times can be long

## Recommendations

We're trialing Rust for performance-critical services and CLI tools. Teams should experiment with it in non-critical projects to evaluate its fit for our use cases.

# Dagster

## Overview

Dagster is a cloud-native data pipeline orchestrator for the whole development lifecycle, with integrated lineage and observability, a declarative programming model, and best-in-class testability.

## Why Assess?

- **Developer Experience**: Superior DX with type safety
- **Testing**: First-class support for testing
- **Observability**: Built-in lineage and monitoring
- **Asset-Centric**: Asset-based approach vs task-based
- **Modern Architecture**: Cloud-native design

## Use Cases

- Data pipeline orchestration
- ML pipeline management
- Data quality monitoring
- Complex workflow management

## Considerations

- Relatively new compared to alternatives
- Smaller community than Airflow
- Learning curve for asset paradigm
- Migration effort from existing tools

## Assessment Plan

We're evaluating Dagster for new data pipeline projects. Teams should explore it in pilot projects and compare it with our existing Airflow deployments.

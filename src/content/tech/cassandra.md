# Apache Cassandra

## Overview

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers with no single point of failure.

## Status: Assess (Moving Down)

While Cassandra has strong technical merits, we're reassessing its place in our stack due to:

- **Operational Complexity**: Requires significant expertise to operate
- **Better Alternatives**: Cloud-native solutions often simpler
- **Team Expertise**: Limited in-house knowledge
- **Changing Needs**: Our use cases may be better served elsewhere

## Historical Use Cases

- Time-series data
- High-write workloads
- Multi-datacenter replication
- Always-on applications

## Considerations

- Requires dedicated operations team
- Complex tuning and optimization
- Limited transaction support
- Eventual consistency model

## Recommendations

For new projects, evaluate cloud-native alternatives like DynamoDB or managed time-series databases. Existing Cassandra deployments should be maintained but consider migration paths.
